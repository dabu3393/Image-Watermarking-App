## Getting Started

The Image Watermark Adder is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select images, add watermarks to them, and save the watermarked images. It simplifies the process of protecting images with a watermark.

## Key Features

- **Image Selection**: Easily select one or more images from your local system. Supported image formats include JPG, PNG, and JPEG.

- **Thumbnail Display**: The application displays selected images as thumbnails on a scrollable canvas, making it convenient for users to see and choose images for watermarking.

- **Watermark Addition**: Users can add a watermark image to the selected image. The watermark image should be provided separately and should contain the watermark to be applied.

- **Adjustable Watermark Size**: The application scales the watermark image to fit the selected image, maintaining aspect ratio, and allows users to control the opacity (transparency) of the watermark.

- **Output Image Saving**: After adding the watermark, users can choose the destination to save the watermarked image.



## Usage

1. Run the image_watermark_adder.py script to start the application.
2. Click the "Add Images" button to select one or more images for watermarking.
3. Select an image from the thumbnails displayed on the canvas.
4. Click the "Add Watermark" button to add a watermark to the selected image.
5. Choose the destination and file name to save the watermarked image.
